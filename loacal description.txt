# ðŸŽ¨ Spritesheet Tool  
by Juste Mow  

A small custom tool for managing sprite sheets.  
You can start from:
- a spritesheet
- a folder of images
- or a video

It allows you to:
- preview animations
- remove specific frames
- adjust frame offsets (by rows, columns, or individually)

And export to:
- new spritesheets based on a custom layout
- separate images in a folder
- animated GIFs

If you find it useful, have an idea for a new feature, or discover a bug â€” feel free to leave me a message! ðŸ˜‰
